\title{Upload a file to OpenRefine}
\usage{
refine_upload(file, project.name = NULL, open.browser = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Path to file to upload; upload format is inferred from the file extension, and currently only ".csv" and ".tsv" files are allowed.}

\item{project.name}{Optional parameter to specify name of the project to be created upon upload; default is \code{NULL} and project will be named 'Untitled' in OpenRefine}

\item{open.browser}{Boolean for whether or not the browser should open on successful upload; default is \code{FALSE}}

\item{...}{Additional parameters to be inherited by \code{\link{refine_path}}; allows users to specify \code{host} and \code{port} arguments if the OpenRefine instance is running at a location other than \verb{http://127.0.0.1:3333}}
}
\value{
Operates as a side-effect, either opening a browser and pointing to the OpenRefine instance (if \code{open.browser=TRUE}) or issuing a message.
}
\description{
This function attempts to upload contents of a file and create a new project in OpenRefine. Users can optionally navigate directly to the running instance to interact with the project. The function wraps the OpenRefine API \verb{/command/core/create-project-from-upload} query.
